		<h1>Iconography</h1>
		
		<p class="standfirst">The UCL Design Language recommends the use of <a href="http://hlvticons.ch/">Hlvticons</a> when icons are required.</p>
		
		<p>They are available from within the <a href="https://github.com/UCL-WAMS/indigo/">UCL Design Language github</a> to download as data-uri files, that can be referenced within your site code.</p>
		
		<p>Due to licencing restrictions if they are required in another format, for example when using in visuals then please <a href="#">contact the Indigo team</a>. Similarly if the icon you require is not available within the current download, then <a href="#">contact the Indigo team</a> to discuss the purchase of any additional Hlvticon icon packs.</p>
