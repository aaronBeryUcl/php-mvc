				<h1>Expanding the UCL Foundation</h1>
				
				<p class="standfirst">The UCL Foundation can be the starting point for many UCL digital products. Through creative use of additional design devices, UCL digital products can be designed to appeal to distinct audiences.</p>
			</header>

					<h2>Constraints</h2>
					<p>The decision to expand upon the UCL Foundation should be individually determined, but the following restrictions must be observed.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>All elements of the UCL Foundation <strong>must</strong> be retained. *</li>
						<li>The <a href="navigation.php">UCL Masthead, Banner and Footer</a> <strong>must</strong> be retained.</li>
						<li>The site <strong>must</strong> adhere to the UCL <a href="principles.php">Design Language Principles</a>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Unless deviation is described below.</p>
				
				<br />
				
				<h3>Example design devices for expanding the UCL Foundation</h3>

				</div>
				
				<p>UCL Venue is an demo of a website, that has used design devices to add creativity and personality, whilst retaining the elements of the UCL Foundation and still adhering to the Principles. You can read more about this, and other websites in the <a href="/casestudies/">Case Studies</a> section.</p>
				
				<h4>1. The Box Shadow</h4>
				<p>A box shadow has been added as a bold, coloured design device used on boxed content elements. The colours are still drawn from the <a href="colour.php">UCL palette</a></p>
				
				<h4>2. Exaggerated type</h4>
				<p>Bold, creative use of headline typography is an option for expanding on the UCL foundation. However, deviation from UCL typefaces, size and weight should be <strong>limited to headlines only</strong>. All other core aspects of the UCL digital typography (fonts, line-height, size etc) should be retained.</p>
				
				<h4>3. Buttons &amp; iconography</h4>
				<p>For additional visual richness, buttons and iconography can be designed to suite the needs of the audience and functionality. This represents an opportunity for distinctiveness and creativity.</p>
				
				<h4>4. Background images</h4>
				<p>Use of background images can add depth of content and provide opportunities for art direction.</p>
				
				<h4>5. Pushing the grid</h4>
				<p>Deviations from the UCL Foundation grid can be an opportunity for creative layouts, such as using negative margins to break elements out of the grid.</p>
