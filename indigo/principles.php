					<dt id="1">1. Design for users</dt>
					<dd>We design for the users of the website or application first. We must understand the user's needs well, through use of good research and data to back up design decisions. users - developers, site owners, marketing, </dd>
					
					<dt id="2">2. Modularity</dt>
					<dd>Modularity should be at the core of Indigo to enable re-use of the design system, patterns and, ultimately, the code.</dd>
					
					<dt id="3">3. Technical independence</dt>
					<dd>Indigo should be technically agnostic built using web standards principles.</dd>
					
					<dt id="4">4. Build the interface as the brand</dt>
					<dd>Through intelligent and creative use of UCL's brand typography and colour usage, build the brand into the very heart of Indigo.</dd>
					
					<dt id="5">5. Design for content</dt>
					<dd>Design for content, not devices or screen widths. Whilst employing responsive design principles, we must build to content first, and devices second. We should aim for content parity across media and devices.</dd>
					
					<dt id="6">6. Simplicity and clarity at the core</dt>
					<dd>Wherever possible, we must try to reduce complexity. This includes functionality, user experience and, above all, copywriting. Labelling should be clear and building upon Principle 1.</dd>
					
					<dt id="7">7. Lower the on-ramp</dt>
					<dd>Design Indigo for rapid design and development by providing a tool-kit of patterns for site commissioners, content creators, designers and developers.</dd>
					
					<dt id="8">8. Build sustainable components</dt>
					<dd>The design patterns should be agnostic to container width allowing placement across the design system allowing for future-friendly adoption by a myriad of screen sizes.</dd>
					
					<dt id="9">9. Place Indigo at the heart of new site commissioning. </dt>
					<dd>Through potentially new site commissioning and development processes, place Indigo at the heart. Indigo should be the defacto standard and starting point for all new site creation.</dd>
					
					<dt id="10">10. Easy to learn and pleasant to use.</dt>
					<dd>Indigo should not be difficult to use and be where site owners and developers need it most: commissioning, planning, designing or developing. Indigo should easily provide answers to design problems.</dd>
					
					<dt id="11">11. Smart defaults</dt>
					<dd>Where there are transactions required by the user (search, filling and submitting forms, for example), we ensure the default settings are devoid of ambiguity.</dd>
